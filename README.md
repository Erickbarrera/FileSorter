FileSorter
==========

Removes duplicate files from a directory, written in Java

Originally written to sort SNES roms from a directory which contained thousands of duplicate and multilanguage roms 
into a clean directory with no duplicates and only the english version of roms.  (That's why it uses "(E)" and "(U)" 
as delimiters.
